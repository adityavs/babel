If you have a support request or question please submit them to one of this resources:

* Slack Community Chat: https://babeljs.slack.com (you can sign-up at https://slack.babeljs.io/ for an invite)
* StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/babeljs using the tag `babeljs`
* Twitter: If it's just a quick question you can ping our Twitter: https://twitter.com/babeljs
* Also have a look at the readme for more information on how to get support:
  https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/README.md

Issues on GitHub are intended to be related to problems of Babel itself,
so we try not to answer support questions here.
